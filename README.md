# fusion-purple
FusionPurple is a Python/Flask web application template developed for personal and commercial projects.

Based on lessons learned building Flask apps for large scientific applications I built this template project structure. This template
is ideal for projects meant to live both server and client side. It has been pre-configuered to enable any Python or web develoepr to quickly get off the ground with features such as Blueprints, Javascript charts (via Highcharts), POST/GET routes, Debug mode enabled, dynamic port assignment, and more.

## Technologies used:
* `Python 3` installed via Anaconda https://www.continuum.io/downloads
